## Business Intelligence Analysis Report for Kultra Mega Stores (KMS)

### 📊 Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth business intelligence analysis for **Kultra Mega Stores (KMS)**, a Lagos-based supplier of office furniture and supplies. The objective was to support the **Abuja division** by analyzing historical order data spanning **2009 to 2012** using SQL.

The dataset was provided in Excel format by the Business Manager. It includes records of customer transactions, product categories, regional performance, shipping details, and returns.

As a **Business Intelligence Analyst**, I applied my SQL expertise gained from the DSA Data Analysis program to examine the data and answer critical business questions categorized into two case scenarios.

## 🧠 Case Scenario I – Sales and Operational Performance

The first part of the analysis focused on product sales, regional trends, shipping expenses, and customer revenue segmentation. I successfully answered the following:

1. **Highest Sales by Product Category**  
   → Identified the product category with the highest aggregate sales using SQL aggregation and ordering.

2. **Top 3 and Bottom 3 Regions by Sales**  
   → Ranked regions by total sales and extracted the top and bottom performers.

3. **Total Sales of Appliances in Ontario**  
   → Filtered sales records by category and region, and computed total sales.

4. **Recommendations for Boosting Revenue from Bottom 10 Customers**  
   → Isolated the lowest-performing customers and offered actionable strategies including personalized discounts, improved customer support, and targeted upselling.

5. **Shipping Method with the Highest Cost**  
   → Calculated total shipping cost per method and identified the most expensive one.

## 📊 Case Scenario II – Customer and Segment-Level Insights

This section focused on understanding customer value, segment behavior, and alignment between shipping choices and order urgency. The following questions were analyzed:

6. **Most Valuable Customers & Their Purchase Patterns**  
   → Determined by highest profit contribution and reviewed their most purchased categories or services.

7. **Highest Sales from a Small Business Customer**  
   → Identified based on the segment and ranked by total sales.

8. **Most Active Corporate Customer (by Order Volume)**  
   → Counted total orders placed by corporate customers during the analysis period.

9. **Most Profitable Consumer Customer**  
   → Computed using total profit generated by each consumer-segment customer.

10. **Customers Who Returned Items & Their Segment**  
    → Reviewed return records and matched them to customer segments.

11. **Shipping Cost vs. Order Priority Efficiency**  
    → Compared high-cost shipping methods (e.g., Express Air) to order priorities to determine if the use of such services was justified. Recommendations were made based on the level of alignment.
