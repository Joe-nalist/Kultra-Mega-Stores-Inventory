# Kultra-Mega-Stores-Inventory

## Business Intelligence Analysis Report for Kultra Mega Stores (KMS)

### üìä Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth business intelligence analysis for **Kultra Mega Stores (KMS)**, a Lagos-based supplier of office furniture and supplies. The objective was to support the **Abuja division** by analyzing historical order data spanning **2009 to 2012** using SQL.

The dataset was provided in Excel format by the Business Manager. It includes records of customer transactions, product categories, regional performance, shipping details, and returns.

As a **Business Intelligence Analyst**, I applied my SQL expertise gained from the DSA Data Analysis program to examine the data and answer critical business questions categorized into two case scenarios.

## üß† Case Scenario I ‚Äì Sales and Operational Performance

The first part of the analysis focused on product sales, regional trends, shipping expenses, and customer revenue segmentation. I successfully answered the following:

1. **Highest Sales by Product Category**  
   ‚Üí Identified the product category with the highest aggregate sales using SQL aggregation and ordering.

2. **Top 3 and Bottom 3 Regions by Sales**  
   ‚Üí Ranked regions by total sales and extracted the top and bottom performers.

3. **Total Sales of Appliances in Ontario**  
   ‚Üí Filtered sales records by category and region, and computed total sales.

4. **Recommendations for Boosting Revenue from Bottom 10 Customers**  
   ‚Üí Isolated the lowest-performing customers and offered actionable strategies including personalized discounts, improved customer support, and targeted upselling.

5. **Shipping Method with the Highest Cost**  
   ‚Üí Calculated total shipping cost per method and identified the most expensive one.

## üìä Case Scenario II ‚Äì Customer and Segment-Level Insights

This section focused on understanding customer value, segment behavior, and alignment between shipping choices and order urgency. The following questions were analyzed:

6. **Most Valuable Customers & Their Purchase Patterns**  
   ‚Üí Determined by highest profit contribution and reviewed their most purchased categories or services.

7. **Highest Sales from a Small Business Customer**  
   ‚Üí Identified based on the segment and ranked by total sales.

8. **Most Active Corporate Customer (by Order Volume)**  
   ‚Üí Counted total orders placed by corporate customers during the analysis period.

9. **Most Profitable Consumer Customer**  
   ‚Üí Computed using total profit generated by each consumer-segment customer.

10. **Customers Who Returned Items & Their Segment**  
    ‚Üí Reviewed return records and matched them to customer segments.

11. **Shipping Cost vs. Order Priority Efficiency**  
    ‚Üí Compared high-cost shipping methods (e.g., Express Air) to order priorities to determine if the use of such services was justified. Recommendations were made based on the level of alignment.

### üõ† Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Microsoft Excel** | Source of data |
| **MySQL / SQL Server** | Data querying and transformation |
| **SQL** | Writing queries to answer case scenario questions |

### üìÅ Dataset

The dataset contains information on Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in **Lagos, Nigeria**, specializes in **office supplies and furniture**, serving:
- Individual Consumers
- Small Businesses (Retail)
- Large Corporate Clients (Wholesale)

### üßπ Data Preparation

- Cleaned raw data in Excel by removing duplicates and standardizing formats.
- Uploaded cleaned data to **SQL Server** for efficient querying and structured storage.
- Normalized tables and defined primary/foreign key relationships where applicable.

### üßæ SQL Analysis

#### Key queries performed include:
- Which product category had the highest sales?

```sql 
SELECT TOP 1
   product_category,
  SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
  GROUP BY product_category
  ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

```

- What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
  
```sql
SELECT TOP 3
    Region,
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;


SELECT TOP 3
    Region,
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY total_sales ASC;
```

- What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
WHERE product_sub_category = 'Appliances' AND Province = 'Ontario';
```

- Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers
  
‚Üí After analyzing sales data from the bottom 10 customers, it's evident that they contribute minimally due to low purchase frequency and    small average order values. To increase revenue from this segment, we recommend:

- Introducing personalized promotions and loyalty programs

- Upselling complementary or higher-margin products

- Direct engagement to understand barriers to larger purchases

```sql
SELECT TOP 10
    customer_name,
    SUM(sales) AS total_revenue
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_revenue ASC;


SELECT 
    customer_name, 
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_purchases,
    SUM(sales) AS total_spent
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
WHERE customer_name IN (
    SELECT TOP 10 customer_name
    FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
    GROUP BY customer_name
    ORDER BY SUM(sales) ASC
)
GROUP BY customer_name;
```

- KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?

```sql
SELECT TOP 1
    ship_mode,
    SUM(shipping_cost) AS total_shipping_cost
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
GROUP BY ship_mode
ORDER BY total_shipping_cost DESC;
```

- Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically purchase?

```sql
SELECT TOP 10
    customer_name,
    SUM(sales) AS total_spent
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;



SELECT 
    customer_name,
    product_category,
    COUNT(*) AS times_purchased,
    SUM(sales) AS total_spent_on_item
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
WHERE customer_name IN (
    SELECT TOP 10 customer_name
    FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
    GROUP BY customer_name
    ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC
)
GROUP BY customer_name, product_category
ORDER BY customer_name, total_spent_on_item DESC;
```

- Which small business customer had the highest sales?

```sql
SELECT TOP 1
    customer_name,
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
WHERE customer_segment = 'Small Business'
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

- Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 ‚Äì 2012?

```sql
SELECT TOP 1
    customer_name,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
WHERE customer_segment= 'Corporate'
  AND YEAR(order_date) BETWEEN 2009 AND 2012
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY number_of_orders DESC;
```

- Which consumer customer was the most profi table one?

```sql
SELECT TOP 1
    customer_name,
    SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
WHERE customer_segment = 'Consumer'
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;
```

- Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?

 ‚Üí Got customers who returned items, inferred by negative profit, and showed:

- Customer Name
- Customer Segment
- Number of returned items (rows)

```sql
SELECT 
    [Customer_Name],
    [Customer_Segment],
    COUNT(*) AS [Returned Items Count]
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
WHERE [Profit] < 0
GROUP BY [Customer_Name], [Customer_Segment]
ORDER BY [Returned Items Count] DESC;
```

- If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer

 ‚Üí Based on the analysis, KMS did not always align shipping method with order priority. In several cases, low-priority orders were           shipped using Express Air, incurring high costs unnecessarily. Conversely, some high-priority orders were delivered using Delivery        Truck, which may delay critical deliveries. This indicates an opportunity to optimize logistics policy by enforcing stricter alignment    between shipping urgency and cost.

```sql
SELECT 
    [Order_Priority],
    [Ship_Mode],
    COUNT(*) AS Order_Count,
    SUM([Shipping_Cost]) AS Total_Shipping_Cost,
    AVG([Shipping_Cost]) AS Avg_Shipping_Cost
FROM [KMS Sql case Study]
GROUP BY [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode]
ORDER BY [Order_Priority], Avg_Shipping_Cost DESC;
```
